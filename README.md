# junit_ant
Running unit tests with ant

Navigate to the scripts directory and run the 'ant test' command
This will pull down the necessary dependencies to run the junit tests

You should see an output like
[junit] Tests run: 4, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.231 sec

If you look in the unit tests you can see that one of the tests was built to purposely fail
